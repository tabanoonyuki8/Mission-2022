           <h2>Goals</h2>
           <p>Being able to make 'things'. It doesn't matter if they are super technical or anything just being able to apply the theory or stuff you've read will cement it in your head and you will find that your problems are no longer in writing the actual code but to visualize the systems you create and bringing them into being. As a CS uni student.</p>

           <h1><b>Develop without limits</b></h1>
           <p>High staff turnover isn’t new for youth-focused and social justice organizations.  You expected it. You could deal with it.  You hired and onboarded new people all the time. That was before 2020. 

            Now your organization struggles with burnout of current staff and meeting the needs of your participants.  You (and your team) are already doing the work of many more.  </p>

<h1><b>Know our Global Community</b></h1>
<p>Your choice of programming communities (know as discussion boards, forums, bulletin boards, etc.) will often determine the pace of your progression in your particular language that you’re learning. I don’t think there is an answer as to why, but real-time communities provide a one of a kind learning experience.</p>
